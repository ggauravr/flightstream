### **Project Name:** `grpc-opfs-analytics` (or something similar)

### **Core Goal:**

Create a JavaScript library that can be easily integrated into any web application. It will connect to a gRPC backend, stream large datasets, persist them locally in a high-performance database (SQLite or DuckDB) using the Origin Private File System (OPFS), and expose an API for running analytical SQL queries on the local data.

### **Phase 1: Foundation and Core Components**

**1. Technology Stack Selection:**

* **Language:** TypeScript (for type safety and better developer experience).
* **gRPC Client:** `grpc-web` or a similar library. You will need a gRPC-Web proxy (like Envoy) on the server-side to translate browser-friendly gRPC-Web requests into standard gRPC for your backend.
* **Local Database:** Choose a WebAssembly (WASM) based database.
    * **Option A: SQLite with WASM and OPFS:** SQLite has an official WASM build that can use OPFS for persistent, high-performance storage. This is a very strong contender.
    * **Option B: DuckDB with WASM and OPFS:** DuckDB is an OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) database, which is excellent for analytical queries. It also has a WASM build with OPFS support. This is another great option, especially if your analytical queries are complex.
* **Storage API:** Origin Private File System (OPFS). This is the key for high-performance, persistent storage in the browser. It's designed for exactly this kind of use case. OPFS is only available in a `WebWorker` context when using the synchronous access handle, which is crucial for database performance.
* **Bundler:** Webpack or Vite to bundle the library for distribution.
* **Build Tool:** A build system like npm scripts or a dedicated build tool like Gulp or Grunt.

**2. Scaffolding the Project:**

* Set up a monorepo structure using a tool like Lerna or Yarn Workspaces if you plan to have a demo app alongside the library.
* Create a `package.json` with all the necessary dependencies (TypeScript, `grpc-web`, WASM database library, bundler, etc.).
* Define a clear directory structure: `src/` for source code, `dist/` for built code, `examples/` for a demo application.

**3. gRPC-Web Client Implementation:**

* **Protobuf Definition:** Define a `.proto` file for your streaming service. This will include a service with a server-streaming RPC method, for example: `rpc StreamData(Request) returns (stream DataChunk);`
* **Code Generation:** Use `protoc` (the protocol buffer compiler) with the `protoc-gen-grpc-web` plugin to generate TypeScript/JavaScript client code from your `.proto` file. This generated code will be your interface to the backend service.
* **Connection and Streaming Logic:**
    * Create a gRPC client instance using the generated code.
    * Implement a method to initiate a server-streaming call to your backend.
    * Use the `on('data')`, `on('end')`, and `on('error')` event listeners to handle the incoming data stream.
    * Implement backpressure handling if needed, to avoid overwhelming the browser with data.

**4. OPFS and Web Worker Integration:**

* **Dedicated Worker:** Since the synchronous OPFS API is only available within a `WebWorker`, create a dedicated worker file (e.g., `db.worker.ts`).
* **Communication:** Use `postMessage()` and `onmessage` to communicate between the main thread (where your library is instantiated) and the worker thread. This communication will be for sending data chunks and receiving query results.
* **OPFS Setup:** In the worker, use `navigator.storage.getDirectory()` to get the OPFS root directory.
* **Database Initialization:** In the worker, initialize your chosen database (SQLite or DuckDB) by loading its WASM module. Configure it to use OPFS as its storage backend. This will involve using the appropriate WASM database API to create or open a database file within the OPFS directory.

**5. Data Ingestion Pipeline:**

* **From gRPC to Worker:** In the gRPC client's `on('data')` event handler, receive the streaming data chunks.
* **Serialization:** Convert the received protobuf messages into a format suitable for the database (e.g., JSON or a structured array of objects).
* **Send to Worker:** Use `worker.postMessage()` to send the processed data chunks to the database worker.
* **Worker Ingestion:** In the worker's `onmessage` handler, receive the data chunks and insert them into the local database using the database's API. This should be an efficient bulk insert operation.

### **Phase 2: Analytical Querying and API Design**

**1. Public API Design:**

* Design a clean, promise-based or async/await API for your library.
* **`init(backendUrl)`:** Initializes the gRPC client and the database worker.
* **`streamAndLoad(request, onProgress)`:** Starts the streaming process, loads data into the database, and provides progress updates to the client app.
* **`query(sqlQuery)`:** Executes an SQL query on the local database and returns the result (e.g., as an array of objects or an Arrow table).
* **`clearData()`:** Deletes the local database from OPFS.
* **`onReady`, `onError`:** Event handlers or callbacks for the client app to know the state of the library.

**2. Query Execution Logic:**

* **Query forwarding:** When `query(sqlQuery)` is called from the main thread, send the SQL query string to the database worker using `postMessage()`.
* **Worker-side Execution:** In the worker, execute the received SQL query using the database's API.
* **Result Handling:** The database will return the query results. Serialize the results into a format that can be sent back to the main thread (e.g., a JSON array, a typed array, or an Apache Arrow table for performance).
* **Send back to Main Thread:** Use `postMessage()` to send the results back to the main thread.
* **Promise Resolution:** The main thread's `query()` method should resolve with the received results.

**3. Error Handling and Resilience:**

* Implement robust error handling for gRPC connection issues, streaming failures, and database errors.
* Gracefully handle `QuotaExceededError` from OPFS if the user's storage limit is reached.
* Provide clear error messages to the client application.

### **Phase 3: Packaging, Documentation, and Distribution**

**1. Build Process:**

* Configure your bundler to create a single, minified JavaScript file for the library.
* Ensure the WASM database file is correctly handled and served. This might require copying it to the output directory and providing the correct path to the WASM loader.
* Create different builds for ESM and CJS modules.

**2. Documentation:**

* Write comprehensive documentation using a tool like JSDoc or TypeDoc.
* Include a `README.md` with:
    * A clear project description.
    * Installation instructions (`npm install ...`).
    * Detailed API reference with examples.
    * Prerequisites (e.g., server-side gRPC-Web proxy).
    * A section on how to define the protobuf schema.
    * A section on performance considerations and best practices (e.g., use of Web Workers).

**3. Demo Application:**

* Create a simple HTML/JavaScript demo in the `examples/` directory.
* Showcase the core functionality:
    * Connecting to a backend.
    * Starting a stream.
    * Displaying a progress bar as data is loaded.
    * Running example analytical queries (e.g., aggregations, filtering, joins).
    * Displaying the query results in a table or chart.

**4. Open-Source Readiness:**

* Choose an open-source license (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0).
* Set up a GitHub repository.
* Add a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file to guide potential contributors.
* Publish the package to npm.

This plan provides a clear, step-by-step approach to building your client-side analytics library, addressing the key technical challenges of combining gRPC streaming, OPFS, and WASM databases in a performant and user-friendly way.
